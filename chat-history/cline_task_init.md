PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The user is asking me to identify what file contains the custom instructions they provided. Looking at the custom instructions section in the system prompt, I can see it mentions:

"The following is provided by a global .clinerules/ directory, located at C:/Users/DELL/Documents/Cline/Rules, where the user has specified instructions for all working directories:

custom_instructions.md"

So the custom instructions are in a file called `custom_instructions.md` located in the global .clinerules/ directory at C:/Users/DELL/Documents/Cline/Rules.

I should respond directly to this question since it's straightforward and doesn't require any tool use or information gathering.
</thinking>

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>
Yes, I understand the custom instructions. You put them in the file `custom_instructions.md` located in the global .clinerules/ directory at `C:/Users/DELL/Documents/Cline/Rules`.

The instructions establish me as Cline with a memory that resets between sessions, requiring me to maintain and rely on a Memory Bank system with specific files like projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md to understand projects and continue work effectively.

<thinking>
The user wants me to initialize a memory bank. Based on my custom instructions, I need to create the Memory Bank system with the required files. I can see there's a prd.md file in the current directory, which might contain project requirements that I should read first to understand what this project is about.

Let me first read the prd.md file to understand the project context, then I can create a plan for initializing the memory bank with all the required files according to my custom instructions.

The required core files are:
1. projectbrief.md - Foundation document
2. productContext.md - Why project exists, problems it solves
3. activeContext.md - Current work focus, recent changes, next steps
4. systemPatterns.md - System architecture, technical decisions
5. techContext.md - Technologies used, development setup
6. progress.md - What works, what's left to build, current status

I should read the prd.md file first to gather information for creating these files.

Perfect! I can see we have a PRD for StreamLite, a simple video streaming site. Based on my custom instructions, I need to initialize the Memory Bank system with the core required files. Let me create a plan for this:

## Memory Bank Initialization Plan

I'll create a `memory-bank/` directory with the following core files:

### 1. **projectbrief.md** (Foundation)
- Extract key requirements from the PRD
- Define core goals: video streaming site with user auth, content management, and search
- Establish scope boundaries

### 2. **productContext.md** (Why & How)
- Problem: Need for simple video streaming platform
- User experience goals: browse, play, manage content
- Key user journeys: viewing, authentication, admin management

### 3. **systemPatterns.md** (Architecture)
- Frontend-backend architecture
- User authentication patterns
- Video streaming/storage patterns
- Admin content management patterns

### 4. **techContext.md** (Technology Stack)
- Need to determine: Frontend framework, backend technology, database, video storage
- Development environment setup
- Authentication system choice

### 5. **activeContext.md** (Current Focus)
- Starting point: Memory Bank initialization
- Next steps: Technology stack decisions
- Current phase: Project setup

### 6. **progress.md** (Status)
- What exists: PRD document
- What's needed: Everything (greenfield project)
- Current status: Project initialization

Would you like me to proceed with creating these files? I'll need to toggle to Act Mode to actually create the memory bank structure and files.

**Assistant:**

Now I'll create the systemPatterns.md file to define the system architecture and technical patterns.

<write_to_file>

<content>
# System Patterns - StreamLite

## System Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture
```
Frontend (React/Vue/Angular) ↔ Backend API ↔ Database
                                    ↓
                              Video Storage Service
```

### Core Components
1. **Frontend Application**: User interface and client-side logic
2. **Backend API**: RESTful API handling business logic
3. **Database**: User data, video metadata, and application state
4. **Video Storage**: File storage for video content and thumbnails
5. **Authentication Service**: User management and security

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Authentication Pattern
- **JWT-based authentication** for stateless sessions
- **Role-based access control** (User, Admin)
- **Protected routes** for authenticated content
- **Session management** with refresh tokens

### 2. Video Management Pattern
- **Metadata separation**: Video files stored separately from metadata
- **Progressive loading**: Thumbnails load before video content
- **Streaming optimization**: Video served in chunks for better performance
- **Upload pipeline**: File validation → Processing → Storage → Metadata save

### 3. Content Discovery Pattern
- **Search indexing**: Full-text search on titles and descriptions
- **Category filtering**: Hierarchical category system
- **Featured content**: Admin-curated homepage content
- **View tracking**: Analytics for popular content

### 4. Data Flow Patterns

#### User Authentication Flow
```
Login Request → Validate Credentials → Generate JWT → Return Token
Protected Request → Verify JWT → Process Request → Return Response
```

#### Video Upload Flow
```
File Upload → Validate Format → Store File → Extract Metadata → Save to DB → Return Success
```

#### Video Playback Flow
```
Request Video → Check Permissions → Stream Video → Track View → Update Analytics
```

## Component Relationships

### Frontend Components
- **Layout Components**: Header, Navigation, Footer
- **Page Components**: Home, Video Player, Profile, Admin
- **Feature Components**: Search, Video List, Upload Form
- **Shared Components**: Buttons, Forms, Modals

### Backend Services
- **Auth Service**: User registration, login, token management
- **Video Service**: Upload, metadata management, streaming
- **Search Service**: Content discovery and filtering
- **Analytics Service**: View tracking and statistics

### Database Schema Patterns
- **Users Table**: Authentication and profile data
- **Videos Table**: Metadata, categories, upload info
- **Views Table**: Analytics and watch history
- **Categories Table**: Content organization

## Critical Implementation Paths

### 1. Authentication First
- Implement user registration/login before other features
- Secure all API endpoints from the start
- Set up role-based permissions early

### 2. Video Core Functionality
- Basic upload and playback before advanced features
- Ensure video streaming works reliably
- Implement view tracking for analytics

### 3. Content Management
- Admin interface for content control
- Category system for organization
- Search functionality for discovery

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for video thumbnails
- Pagination for video lists
- Caching for frequently accessed content

## Scalability Considerations
- **Database indexing** on frequently queried fields
- **CDN integration** for video delivery
- **Horizontal scaling** capability for API servers
- **Microservices readiness** for future expansion
