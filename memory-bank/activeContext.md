## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions (FINALIZED)
- **Microservices**: 4 independent services with direct communication
- **No API Gateway**: Services communicate directly for simplicity
- **Database per Service**: SQLite isolation for each microservice
- **Mobile-First**: React Native for cross-platform mobile development

### Technology Choices (FINALIZED)
- **Frontend**: React Native + TypeScript for iOS/Android development
- **Backend**: Go + Fiber for high-performance microservices
- **Database**: SQLite + GORM for lightweight, per-service data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with centralized Auth Service validation

### Service Communication Pattern
- **Direct HTTP Calls**: React Native → Individual Services
- **Service-to-Service**: Other services → Auth Service for token validation
- **Port Allocation**: 8001-8004 for services, 8081 for React Native Metro
- **CORS Configuration**: Each service handles React Native CORS independently

### Development Approach (UPDATED)
- **Feature-by-Feature**: Complete backend + frontend per feature before next feature
- **Backend-First**: Implement and test backend endpoints before frontend development
- **Auth Service Foundation**: Start with authentication as base for all other services
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Focus on mobile performance and 3G/4G optimization
- **Testing Strategy**: Backend API testing → Frontend integration → Complete feature testing

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with multiple service directories
- **Service Independence**: Each Go service is self-contained with its own database
- **Shared Types**: Common data structures shared between services
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns within each service

### Development Workflow
- **Service-Specific Branches**: Feature branches prefixed by service name
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Container-First**: Docker development environment from day one
- **Hot Reload**: Air for Go services, Metro for React Native

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices and varying network speeds
2. **Fast Video Streaming**: HLS/DASH adaptive streaming for smooth playback
3. **Offline Capability**: React Native offline support for downloaded content
4. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across iOS and Android

## Learnings and Project Insights

### From Architecture Evolution
- Microservices provide better scalability but increase complexity
- Go's performance benefits outweigh the learning curve for video streaming
- React Native enables faster mobile development than native apps
- SQLite per service simplifies development while maintaining data isolation

### Technical Considerations
- Service communication patterns need careful design for performance
- Video streaming will benefit significantly from Go's concurrency model
- Mobile-first approach requires different UX considerations than web
- Authentication across services needs consistent JWT validation

### Risk Factors
- Microservices complexity for initial development team
- React Native video playback performance on older devices
- Service orchestration and deployment complexity
- Cross-service data consistency challenges

### Development Strategy Insights
- Start with Auth Service as foundation for all other services
- Build Video and Streaming services in parallel for faster iteration
- Use Docker from day one to avoid environment inconsistencies
- Focus on mobile performance optimization from the beginning

### Critical Technical Patterns (IMPORTANT)
- **SQLite Driver Issue**: Always use `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go) instead of `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` (requires CGO)
- **Database Connection Pattern**: Use `sqlite.Dialector{DriverName: "sqlite", DSN: "database.db"}` with `_ "modernc.org/sqlite"` import
- **CGO Dependency**: Avoid CGO dependencies in Go services for easier deployment and cross-compilation
- **Database Configuration**: Always include `?_pragma=foreign_keys(1)` in SQLite connection string for referential integrity

#### When to Update endpoint_used.md:
1. **New Screen Creation**: When creating new screens that call backend APIs
2. **New Endpoint Integration**: When existing screens start using new backend endpoints
3. **Service Modifications**: When backend services add/modify/remove endpoints
4. **API Changes**: When request/response structures change
5. **New Component Integration**: When components like modals start using backend APIs

#### Update Process:
1. **Identify New Endpoints**: Document the new endpoint(s) being integrated
2. **Screen Classification**: Determine which screen/component uses the endpoint
3. **Service Mapping**: Identify which backend service (Auth/User/Video/Streaming) provides the endpoint
4. **Documentation Format**: Follow the established table format with Method, Purpose, Request Data, Response Data
5. **File Update**: Add new endpoints to the appropriate screen section in endpoint_used.md
6. **Summary Update**: Update the summary statistics (total endpoints, endpoints by service, etc.)

#### Documentation Template for New Endpoints:
```markdown
### [ScreenName].tsx
**Services**: [Service Name] (Port [XXXX])

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Request Data | Response Data |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `/api/v1/[endpoint]` | [METHOD] | [Purpose description] | `{ [request structure] }` | `[Response structure]` |
```

#### Memory Bank Integration:
- **activeContext.md**: Document the integration work and endpoint additions
- **progress.md**: Update feature completion status including endpoint documentation
- **systemPatterns.md**: Update if new API patterns or service communication patterns are established

This workflow ensures that the endpoint documentation remains current and serves as an accurate reference for the entire development team.

## 🎯 COMPLETED TASKS (LATEST UPDATE - THUMBNAIL 404 FIX)

### Critical Thumbnail 404 Bug Fix ✅ - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Different URL patterns between screens - HomeScreen uses API endpoints while PlaylistsScreen/ProfileScreen use direct file paths
- ✅ **Static File Serving Added**: Added `app.Static("/storage", "./storage")` middleware to video service main.go
- ✅ **URL Pattern Analysis**: HomeScreen uses `/api/v1/videos/{id}/thumbnail/{size}` (API) vs PlaylistsScreen uses `/storage/thumbnails/large/video_29.jpg` (static)
- ✅ **Fix Implementation**: Single line addition enables direct access to storage files while maintaining API endpoint functionality
- ✅ **Testing Completed**: Verified both static file serving and API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ **Cross-Screen Compatibility**: Fix enables thumbnails to work in PlaylistsScreen, ProfileScreen, and maintains HomeScreen functionality

### Technical Implementation Details ✅
- ✅ **Static Middleware**: Added between Swagger documentation and API routes in main.go
- ✅ **File Access**: Direct access to `/storage/thumbnails/large/video_29.jpg` now returns 200 OK with correct MIME type
- ✅ **API Preservation**: Existing API endpoints `/api/v1/videos/29/thumbnail/large` continue working with cache headers
- ✅ **Performance**: Static serving is more efficient than API endpoints for direct file access
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Both URL patterns now work, providing flexibility for different UI components

### Test Results ✅
- ✅ **Static File Test**: `http://localhost:8003/storage/thumbnails/large/video_29.jpg` → 200 OK (22,799 bytes)
- ✅ **API Endpoint Test**: `http://localhost:8003/api/v1/videos/29/thumbnail/large` → 200 OK with cache headers
- ✅ **Multiple Thumbnails**: Verified video_1.jpg and video_29.jpg in different sizes work correctly
- ✅ **Service Health**: Video service running properly on port 8003
- ✅ **PlaylistDetailScreen Fix**: Corrected port from 8083 to 8003 in thumbnail URL construction
- ✅ **Cross-Screen Verification**: All screens now display thumbnails correctly (Home, Profile, Playlists, PlaylistDetail)

## 🎯 COMPLETED TASKS (PREVIOUS UPDATE - THUMBNAIL QUALITY FIX)

### Homepage Thumbnail Quality Improvement ✅ - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified that Homepage uses medium-sized thumbnails (320x180) while Profile and Playlist screens use large-sized thumbnails (640x360)
- ✅ **Quality Discrepancy Investigation**: Analyzed VideoThumbnail component usage across different screens to understand thumbnail loading differences
- ✅ **Simple Frontend Fix**: Changed VideoThumbnail component default size from 'medium' to 'large' in single line change
- ✅ **Cross-Screen Consistency**: Ensured all screens now use high-quality thumbnails (640x360 resolution)
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing functionality while upgrading default quality

### Technical Implementation Details ✅
- ✅ **File Modified**: `mobile/StreamLiteMobile/src/components/VideoThumbnail.tsx`
- ✅ **Change Made**: Updated default size parameter from `size = 'medium'` to `size = 'large'` on line 25
- ✅ **Impact**: Homepage thumbnails now use 640x360 resolution instead of 320x180
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing calls to VideoThumbnail component automatically get higher quality
- ✅ **Performance**: No negative impact as large thumbnails already exist and are used by other screens

### User Experience Improvements ✅
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Homepage thumbnails now match the quality of Profile and Playlist screens
- ✅ **Enhanced Quality**: Users see crisp, high-resolution thumbnails across all screens
- ✅ **Professional Appearance**: Eliminated quality discrepancy that was noticeable to users
- ✅ **Mobile Optimization**: Better thumbnail quality for high-DPI mobile displays

## 🎯 COMPLETED TASKS (LATEST UPDATE - CRITICAL BUG FIXES)

### Critical Bug Fixes ✅ - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Issue 1: Missing Profile for User ID 10**: Fixed missing profile by manually creating profile for user ID 10 via user service API
- ✅ **Issue 2: View Count Auto-Increment Bug**: Fixed view count incrementing on every GetVideo call by:
  - Removing automatic view increment from GetVideo endpoint
  - Creating dedicated view tracking endpoint: `POST /api/v1/videos/{id}/view`
  - Adding trackView function to videoService.ts
  - Updating VideoPlayerScreen to call trackView when play button is pressed
- ✅ **Backend Implementation**: Created view_tracking.go handler and added route to video service
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Updated VideoPlayerScreen handlePlayPause to track views only on actual play

### Technical Implementation Details ✅
- ✅ **Profile Creation**: User ID 10 now has profile with display name "User 10" (verified working)
- ✅ **View Tracking Logic**: Views now increment only when video play button is pressed, not on video detail fetching
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: New POST /api/v1/videos/{id}/view endpoint for proper view tracking
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: VideoPlayerScreen calls videoService.trackView() in handlePlayPause function
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean separation of concerns between video details fetching and view tracking

### Status and Next Steps ✅
- ✅ **Issue 1 Status**: FULLY RESOLVED - User ID 10 profile exists and accessible
- ✅ **Issue 2 Status**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Requires video service restart to take effect
- ✅ **Testing**: Issue 1 verified working, Issue 2 implementation complete and ready for testing after restart

## 🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES

1. **Video Service Restart**: Restart video service to apply view count fix
2. **View Count Testing**: Verify view count only increments on play button press after restart
3. **Frontend Testing**: Test thumbnail display across all screens to verify consistent quality
4. **Multi-User Testing**: Test subscriber counts with multiple user accounts to verify real data
5. **Enhanced Video Features**: Video quality selection, video preview, improved thumbnails
6. **Performance Optimization**: Video streaming optimization, caching, background uploads
